# PowerBI
PowerBI projects
The first project was using the SIMD data ro crate a look up map for areas of low, medium and high crime.
I created this map, with post code lookup to support my search for a new home. I was able to quickly see if houses were in or near areas of high crime.

Refined this project as the data files were very large and the files were struggling to load. Using data modelling techniques I reduced un-used data, redusing it down to jsut the areas I would personally be using.
I used the Performance analyser built in to Power Bi to compare performnace befor and after.
